# RNN-Names-generation
In this project, I used Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to generate names based on their origin country and first letter. I trained a character-level language model using a dataset of names, which included information about their country of origin.

After training the model, I used it to generate new names by providing it with a starting letter and an origin country. The model then predicted the next character in the name based on the previous characters it had seen, and repeated this process until a full name was generated.

I experimented with different hyperparameters and architectures to improve the quality of the generated names. Finally, I evaluated the performance of the model using various metrics, such as Cross entropy loss.
